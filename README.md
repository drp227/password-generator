# Password Generator

## Description
I've created an application for a user to generate a random password based on their preferred, specific criteria. The password must be between
8-128 characters long, and can be a combination of different character types or the same character type (lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols). 
If preferred criteria ever changes, the page must be refreshed to generate a new password.
